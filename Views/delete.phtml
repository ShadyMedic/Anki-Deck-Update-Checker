<p>Are you sure you want to delete <strong><?= $delete_deckName ?></strong>?</p>
<p>Just so you know the consequences:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All of the users of this deck will see a notification when they open this deck, saying that their deck wasn't
        found in our database and it was most likely deleted by the author.
    </li>
    <li>
        Going to update page for this deck will return a "410 â€“ Gone" error. All links to the deck's page on our website
        will be removed from public view as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you choose to reupload/relink this package, it will have a different ID and users of the deck you're going
        to delete will not start seeing potential update notifications again.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Anki package will be permanently deleted from our servers (if you uploaded it to our service)
        and we won't be able to recover it, if you lose your copy.
    </li>
    <li>
        This package's metadata (name, author, version, download link, editing key
        and access key for private decks) will be purged from our database as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        All usage statistics for this package are going to be purged too.
    </li>
    <li>
	    The only information left of this package on our servers will be its ID, a note that it was deleted and a date when
        the deletion happened.
    </li>
</ul>
