            If your deck fits within none of the available categories, set this to "Uncategorized" and webmaster will
            either create a new category for your deck, or assign it to one of the existing ones.

            Private packages will have a generated access code assigned to them. This code will be contained within
            the link that you'll be able to share with your users. Only users with this link will be able to
            download this package, and it will not be listed on the <a href="/browse">browse webpage</a>.<br>
            <strong>Warning:</strong> A package created as public cannot be made private later!

            Editing key is something like a password that is necessary to update this package in the future.
            Take care of the key and keep it private, as anyone with access to it can modify your package and
            push destructive updates to your users.
            Also note, that the key cannot be recovered if forgotten, unless you personally know the webmaster
            of this website.
            You are supposed to use the same key for all of your decks in order to make the work with the system
            easier, but you need to ensure it is strong enough.<br>
            <strong>Do not set the editing key to the same value as any of your passwords to other services!</strong>
            The editing key is not protected by encryption for technical reasons and while we do our best to keep
            the information private, we can never completely prevent data theft.
