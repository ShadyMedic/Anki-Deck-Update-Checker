<p>Public Anki decks uploaded to this service are categorised by their subject.</p>
<p>New categories are added whenever a new deck that can't fit into any existing category is uploaded.</p>
<p>
    Categories on this webpage are sorted by the number of public decks they contain (apart from the "Uncategorized"
    category). You can use <kbd>Ctrl + F</kbd> to search for your desired category quickly.
