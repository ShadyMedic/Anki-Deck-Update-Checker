<p>This is the graph of pseudo-unique users of this Anki deck in the last 30 days.</p>
<details>
    <summary>Learn how these stats are calculated.</summary>
    <p>
        Every time somebody opens any Anki deck with the updater code in its description, an HTTP request is sent to our
        servers to check whether an updated version of the deck is available or not. The result of this request is text
        like "You are using the most up-to-date version of this Anki deck."
    </p>
    <p>
        Every request for checking an update also causes the user's IP address to be logged in a secured text file. The
        IP address is stored in a hashed form, meaning that it cannot be transformed back into the IP address and its
        stored hash is used just as a temporary unique identificator.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every 24 hours, the logs from the previous day are aggregated into one number for each deck â€“ the number of
        unique IP hashes that were logged the day before. This number is stored in our database (and might be later used
        to generate graphs like the one below) and the list of hashes is permanently deleted. That means that only
        hashes logged on the current and previous day are stored and the user's IP address is never stored in plain
        text.
    </p>
    <p>
        The downside of this approach is the inability to distinguish users as humans and instead distinguish them based
        on IP address. That means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If one user opens your Anki package twice during one day, once on their home Wi-Fi and once while using
            their mobile data, they'll be logged as two unique users, instead of as one.
        </li>
        <li>
            If multiple users open your Anki package while being connected to the same Wi-Fi, they'll be all logged as
            one unique user, instead of multiple ones.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because of this, keep in mind that the usage statistics are only approximate.</p>
