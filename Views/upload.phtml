    <p>You now need to insert (or update) autoupdater code into the description of your Anki deck.</p>
    <p>This will allow users of your deck to receive update check and be notified when you upload a new version.</p>
    <p>Don't worry, it's not complicated, just follow the instruction below:</p>

                Select your deck inside your desktop Anki client.<br>

            </li>
            <li>
                Paste the following text into the text field and make sure the checkbox is unchecked.<br>
                <strong>You need to do this everytime you upload a new version, because the code changes slightly
                    between versions!</strong><br>

                or
                red, if you're uploading the first version of a new package).
                Export the package as usual and upload it in the form below.<br>

                If your Anki package is larger, and you compressed your media,
                contact me on Discord (<code>shady_medic</code>) or e-mail me at
                <code>jan [dot] stech [at] posteo [dot] net</code>. You'll still be able to use this service to share
                your package, you'll just need to upload the file elsewhere and your users will be redirected to such
                external webpage from here, when they click the update notification.

                You are about to upload a <b>minor version</b> of this Anki package. That means that current users of

                <small>
                    Keep in mind that minor updates (or patches) should be used only for things like typo or formatting
                    fixes. Simply things that you want to be fixed for new users, but aren't critical enough to spend
                    time
                    updating the whole deck. To create an update-notification-triggering update, go back to the "My
                    Decks"
                    page and click the blue icon instead of the purple one next to this deck.

            <p>Before releasing this first version of your Anki deck, make sure to double-check the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The deck has the correct name and location</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's a good practise to export the deck when it's in the top-most level or has one parent deck
                        at most.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>All the cards within your deck are of the correct note type.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>It's a good idea to make your own note type and name it something like "Basic â€“ Tom's
                        Genetics".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These things cannot be updated later and changing them on your side later will cause failure to update
                any previous versions.

                    more fixes soon, consider uploading a minor update instead. Just go back to the "My Decks" page and
                    click the purple icon instead of the blue one next to this deck.
